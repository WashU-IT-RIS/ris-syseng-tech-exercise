### Deployment Project

#### *Goal:*

Create a script or other automation that creates a working piece
of IT infrastructure.

Choose something you are familiar with -- a web server, a storage
server, anything you want.  It doesn't have to be complicated.  It
should only take a couple hours of effort.  Create a playbook that
builds an instance within a common virtualization platform such as
VirtualBox or one of the major cloud providers, AWS, GCP, or Azure.

#### *Requirements:*

* Demonstrate sensible use of git branching and commits

* Document requirements, assumptions, and instructions

#### *Criteria for Evaluation:*

Your work will be judged on:

* Organization: Is functionality grouped in a meaningful way that is
modular and extensible? Is it reusable in whole or in part? Is it
clear where modifications should go if they are necessary?

* Clarity: Can we understand what it does, and how it does it? Is it
concise, or needlessly verbose and misleading?

* Empathy: Does it reflect a consideration for others, the user, and
coworkers via clear documentation and commits.

* Functionality: Does it work? How do we know?

Feel free to use comments or commit messages to explain things as
you go.  Why did you make certain choices? Point out tips, or lessons
you've learned, or any other opportunity to reveal your background
with the tools and technology.
